# Electroon
Mini Roon controller with tray icon built with Electron

## Getting Started
```
1. Edit config.json and
   change "server_ip" to your Roon core address.
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. npm start
5. Authorize extension in Roon

I'll upload the executable once I get RoonSettingsApi working.

Not sure how to package with the startup flags, so you'll have to create a shortcut and edit the properties.
--enable-transparent-visuals --disable-gpu
```
