# Electroon
Mini Roon controller with tray icon built with Electron

## Getting Started
```
1. Edit config.json
   change "server_ip" to your Roon core address.
2. npm install
3. npm run build
4. npm start
5. Authorize extension in Roon

I'll upload the executable once I get RoonSettingsApi working.
